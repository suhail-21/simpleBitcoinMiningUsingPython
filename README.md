# simpleBitcoinMiningUsingPython

This is a very simple python code for bitcoin mining, and I wrote this on a sunday to escape boredome :P

Bitcoins are ledgers that is used in transactions worldwide, and bitcoin mining is the process of obtaining a nonce value that gives prefix digits of hashcode 0. 
Right now, the number of prefix zeros are 20, and I wrote this code keeping that value as 6. 

Done with the intention of learning python and improving coding skills :) 
Thank you!
